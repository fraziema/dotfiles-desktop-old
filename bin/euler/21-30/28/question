Starting with the number 1 and moving to the right in a clockwise direction a 5 by 5 spiral is formed as follows:

21 22 23 24 25
 20  7  8  9 10
 19  6  1  2 11
 18  5  4  3 12
17 16 15 14 13

It can be verified that the sum of the numbers on the diagonals is 101.

What is the sum of the numbers on the diagonals in a 1001 by 1001 spiral formed in the same way?

====================
quote user 'euler':
First I noted that for an n by n grid, and n being odd, the number in the top right corner is n2. A little mathematical analysis told me that the other corners are given by: n2-n+1, n2-2n+2, and n2-3n+3. Adding these together gives the quadratic, 4n2-6n+6. Then all I had to do was create a loop from 3 to 1001 in steps of 2 and find the running total (starting from 1) of the quadratic.
